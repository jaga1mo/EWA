  - ooh la la what do we have here in this tiny nook
  - need help with something?
  - maybe a forgotten riddle?
  - i know quite a few of those!
  - 'one of them was: I cast spells and potions, in stories I''m stitched; with a
    broom and a cat, my image is hitched. Who am I?'
  - (hmmm... i remember being that one my youth)
  - 'another riddle went something like this: Some say I''m spoken, some believe
    I''m cast; bad luck follows, and fortunes are past. What am I?'
  - (only naughty devils use those...)
  - 'oh and the final one: I roam freely through walls and rooms, creating tales
    of fears and dooms. Though I may float, I''m not a boast. What am I?'
  - (...)
  - (...)
  - (...awkward...)
