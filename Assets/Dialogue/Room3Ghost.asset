  - 
  - I see you've already met my little "friend".
  - can't do much about these nuisances withour a physical body, so thanks for chasing
    it out
  - say, do you want to know what this pedestal thing is?
  - well, frankly i dunno
  - but if i had to guess i think it holds something important
  - and there's another like it
  - there used to be a riddle inscribed on the tablet, but centuries of corrosion
    have left it ineligible
  - of course,  i remember it
  - a sharp mind only dulls in the hands of a fool
  - 'ahem, so the riddle goes as follows: When I trail you closely, you''re never
    alone; often in darkness, from light I am thrown. What am I?'
  - think you can crack this one young one? best of luck to you
  - '*sigh* a millenia has passed i still haven''t the slightest clue...'
