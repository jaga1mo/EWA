  - Hi!
  - You've been sentenced to rot in the dungeon huh?
  - There isn't really much hope for you here...
  - If you pick up something shiny, you'll be able to find it in your Inventory by
    pressing [R].
  - If you want to escape you'll need to find the three shiny keys that unlock the
    Grand Seal.
  - Although...
  - you will probably die here just like the rest of us.
  - Hee hee hee hee hee...
  - HoHoHoHoHo-
  - HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA!!!
