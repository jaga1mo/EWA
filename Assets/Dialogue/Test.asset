  - Hi!
  - So You're the latest to be sentenced to rot in the dungeon huh?
  - wow they even broke your shiny wand..
  - There isn't really much hope for you here is there...
  - You might be able to outrun the rats for a bit by holding [Left shift]...
  - or maybe you can find some scraps to temporarily fix that wand of yours. maybe
    you'd stand a chance...
  - well, If you pick up something shiny, you'll be able to find it in your Inventory
    by pressing [R].
  - though If you want to escape you'll need to find the three shiny keys that unlock
    the Grand Seal.
  - but...
  - you will likely die here just like the rest of us.
  - Hee hee hee hee hee...
  - HoHoHoHoHo-
  - HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA!!!
